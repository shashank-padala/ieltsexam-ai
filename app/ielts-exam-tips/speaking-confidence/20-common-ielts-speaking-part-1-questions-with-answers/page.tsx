          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2">Practice Speaking Aloud</h3>
          <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Record yourself answering questions. Focus on <strong>clear pronunciation</strong> and <strong>natural pace</strong>.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2">Use a Variety of Vocabulary</h3>
          <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Try to include <strong>descriptive words</strong>, <strong>idioms</strong>, and <strong>phrasal verbs</strong> like:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-5 text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <li>‚Äúwind down‚Äù instead of ‚Äúrelax‚Äù</li>

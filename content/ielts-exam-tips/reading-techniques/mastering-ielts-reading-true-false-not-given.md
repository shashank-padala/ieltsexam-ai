# Mastering IELTS Reading: True/False/Not Given Questions

True/False/Not Given questions are among the most challenging in the IELTS Reading test. This guide will help you understand the differences and develop effective strategies.

## Understanding the Question Types

1. **True (Yes)**
   - The statement agrees with the information in the text
   - The information is explicitly stated or clearly implied
   - Example: If the text says "The study was conducted in 2020" and the statement says "The research took place in 2020"

2. **False (No)**
   - The statement contradicts the information in the text
   - The opposite of what is stated is true
   - Example: If the text says "The study was conducted in 2020" and the statement says "The research took place in 2019"

3. **Not Given**
   - The information is not mentioned in the text
   - You cannot determine if the statement is true or false
   - Example: If the text says "The study was conducted in 2020" and the statement says "The research was funded by the government"

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don't use your own knowledge or assumptions
- Don't look for exact word matches

3. **Read the statements** and underline keywords
4. **Scan the text** for similar words or phrases
5. **Compare carefully** the statement with the text
6. **Make your decision** based on the rules above
